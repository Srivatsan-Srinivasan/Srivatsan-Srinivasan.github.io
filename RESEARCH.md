## Overview
Starting early 2015, I have pursued interesting research problems in machine learning algorithms for three major domains - natural language, healthcare and finance.  My primary research under [Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) presently focusses on semi-supervised learning, generative modeling and Reinforcement based imitation learning(inverse reinforcement learning) in healthcare, with special present focus on sepsis. My other parallel research project advised by [Prof.Alexander Rush](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~srush/) as part of CS287 at Harvard, focusses on variational and adversarial generative deep models for sophisticated natural language generation. 

#### Academic Research Projects(Aug, 2017 - May 2019)
1. Inverse Reinforcement/Imitation Learning for Sepsis Treatment
2. Variational and Adversarial Deep Generative Models for Natural Language
3. Input Convex Neural Networks
4. Neural Fictitious Self Play Bot for Poker(Deep Learning/RL)
5. Genetic Algorithm based hyperparameter tuning for deep networks
6. Minimax Beam Search Agent for Connect-6 Game
