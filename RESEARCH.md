## Overview
Starting early 2015, I have pursued state-of-the-art interesting research problems on applied and pure machine learning. The problems have been inspired from three major domains - Natural Language, Healthcare(2017-2019) at Harvard University and Quant Finance(2015-2017) at the Execution Algorithms group at Goldman Sachs.  My primary research under [Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) focusses on semi-supervised learning, generative modeling and Reinforcement based imitation learning(inverse reinforcement learning) in healthcare, with current focus on sepsis treatment in ICUs. My other parallel research project advised by [Prof.Alexander Rush](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~srush/) as part of CS287 at Harvard, focusses on variational and adversarial generative deep models for automated natural language generation.
